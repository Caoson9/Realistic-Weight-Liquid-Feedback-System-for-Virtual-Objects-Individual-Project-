VR for soft robotic exoskeletons: Realistic Weight Liquid Feedback System for Virtual Objects; QMUL DENM70 EMS715P MSc Extended Research Project 2024/25

This project couples a Unity-based VR scene with a controllable liquid device to evoke a felt sense of weight/gravity in head-mounted displays, and explores boosting that sensation with visual cues. The virtual interaction uses the Meta XR SDKâ€™s grab pipeline. A compact, line-based protocol streams hand (grab/release) and mass data over a serial link to an Arduino controller. On the hardware side, a dual-chamber + wristband arrangement with two HX711 load cells and TB6600-driven peristaltic pumps closes the loop. A grab command pumps until the chamber mass reaches its target. A release command pumps back symmetrically to the pre-grab baseline and halts within a configured tolerance. To cut noise and improve stability, motor DIR is set only on mode transitions (with a 20 us settle), while micros() schedules even, non-blocking step pulses. Repeated states and in-flight operations are de-jittered and filtered so the controller ignores redundant traffic. \\

Bench tests show reliable, bidirectional closed-loop behaviour with automatic stop and markedly lower motor noise. With the addition of dynamic visual deformation, colour/texture cues, viewpoint adjustments to the arm, and small, deliberate motion latency as pseudo-tactile hints, we expect users to discriminate object mass more clearly and to feel greater immersion. The main contributions include an end-to-end weight-feedback chain that fits standard Meta XR grabbing workflows, a symmetric pump-in/pump-out control scheme, and a low-noise stepper implementation with practical tuning and safety guards. The approach is intended to be reproducible and transferable to settings such as rehabilitation, sensory integration, immersive interaction, and teaching demonstrations.
